README hkl2elle
This is a process reads a text file in channel format and the output is
the input elle file with unodes and Euler attributes added. The input
file should not have Unodes.

Example:
hkl2elle -i base.elle -e Grain1.txt -u 286 286 0 0 144 2

udata[0]: maximum Y value in the Channel file
udata[1]: maximum X value in the Channel file
udata[2]: origin x [0]
udata[3]: origin y [0]
udata[4]: number of entries in a Channel row
udata[5]: spacing between Channel rows
udata[6]: grid pattern for unodes (0=hexagonal,1=square) [1]

base.elle contains the OPTIONS section and may also include Flynns and Bnodes
Grain1.txt has the following format
X Y Euler1 Euler2 Euler3
0 0 298.11 6.0279 21.064
2 0 292.45 6.5021 26.163

 .
284 286 317.98 37.396 51.140
286 286 318.02 37.273 50.829

The output, hkl2elle001.elle, will be base.elle with a grid of 144
unodes per row in the specified pattern


README elle2channel
This is a process reads an elle file which has unodes with Euler angle attributes. The output is a channel file ".hkl" which can be imported into channel5.

udata[0]: vertical length that the files should have in Channel [164]
udata[1]: horizontal length that the files should have in Channel [164]
udata[2]: vertical step [2]
udata[3]: horizontal step [2]
udata[4]: Flag for Euler angle conversion. Elle is now using Bunge (ZXZ)
as default. [0]


Example:
elle2channel -i Grain1.elle -u 200 200 2 2 

this results in Grain1.elle.hkl file with X Y values:
0 0
2 0
4 0

398 0

If the unode grid does not match the requested hkl grid, the Euler
values are determined by a point-in-region test for the hkl point (in
Elle units). The regions tested are the unode voronoi cells.
